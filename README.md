# Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is about creating an interpreter for the Monty byte files which relies on the stack data structure.

<h2>Compilation</h2>
to compile the interpreter you need to use the following command:

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```
<h2>Usage</h2>
To run the interpreter you need to use the following command:

```
./monty file_name
```
where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code.

<h2> Monty byte code </h2>
Monty byte code is a language that is compiled into Monty byte files. It relies on a unique stack data structure with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty byte codes.
